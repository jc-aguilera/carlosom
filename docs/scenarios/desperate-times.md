# Desperate Times

## Preparations

Your character starts in one of four rooms, depending on the difficulty. In Very Hard, player 1 starts in the waiting room; player 2 starts in the east office. Player 3 starts in the parking garage, and player 4 starts in the main hall. Each player has an initial task, which will make traveling a lot easier.

### Player 1
Push the crate *three times*, then wait for player 4 to take the Ace key from the cabinets. Then, player 4 must *push the box four times*, and give player 1 the Ace Key. Next, player 1 must climb the box to open the safe containing the first plate, take it and give it to player 4. Finally, player 4 must put the plate on the main hall statue, after removing the unicorn medal. If for some reason you cannot push the box, try exiting and reentering the waiting room.

### Player 2
From the starting position, go right to the end of the hallway, then unlock the east wing door (this is the door where you use the heart key in RE2.)

### Player 3
Approach the car closest to the pillar, then push the crate *three times*.

### Player 4

Unlock the single door closest to your starting position. Then go up the emergency ladder at the end of the main hall, and turn right to enter the waiting room. Wait for player 1 to push the box *three times*, then climb it to obtain the Ace key. Descend, then push the box *four times*. Give the key to player 1, wait for him to obtain the first plate and give it to you. Return to the main hall and go past the emergency ladder to find some goodies. Take them, descend the ladder and remove the unicorn medal (it doesn't go into your inventory.) Put the plate where the medal was.

If for some reason you cannot push the box at the waiting room, try exiting and reentering.

## Where to go?

Now you can properly start the map. Since your starting location is somewhat random, I will give directions on how to obtain each plate, then I will mention some other places of interest to obtain more goodies. Make good use of the items outside, and **always replace any item you take with another one**, even if it's just a measly stick.

In this scenario, you will need to open three additional locked doors. You have four options to open them. First, Alyssa can use her lockpick to open them. Second, you can force tackle doors, but zombies will constantly interrupt you; time bombs will will do wonders in this respect. David is needed, though, and in all honesty, he has better uses for batteries. Third, you can reset the room as many times as needed, until zombies start breaking doors from the inside. And lastly, the Joker key will unlock any door.

The Joker key can spawn in one of four places: in the roof, over some metal barrels; in the waiting room, hidden close to the main hall entrance; close to the double doors in the main hall balcony, hidden behind the rails; or inside the substation room, in a drawer right of the room entrance. A second Joker key is in the night duty room, but only Kevin can open the locker containing it. In any case, the following paragraphs assume you are able to open these doors.

## The quest for the plates

### Autopsy plate
Proceed to B1F East hall. Unlock the autopsy room, which is behind the double doors left of the explosive canister at the T-intersection. Inside, you will see several cold chambers, and some goodies. If a cold chamber door is missing, the plate has been already taken! Otherwise, get close to the storage chambers and approach the left corner. Carefully pick up the place, then a zombie will escape the cold storage. Get out of this room, and pick up any goodies you might find in this area.

### Kennel plate
Proceed to B1F West hall. Unlock the kennel, which is located in the middle of the hallway. I will describe a strategy to deal with the dogs that works for me, but feel free deal with them as you wish. Enter the kennel, continue straight through the T-intersection until the camera angle switches, then quickly do a 180ยบ. Wait until your character starts facing the dogs, then return to the entrance, and wait for the dogs to approach the table with an herb. Exit and reenter the kennel, tackle the dogs, and quickly pick up the plate. Now hurry to the exit. If you did this right, you should have taken no damage.

### Interrogation room plate
It would be a good idea to pick up the unicorn medal before continuing, and having as many item slots as possible. Proceed to 1F lobby; at the end of the room, you will find a wooden pole, and a locked door. Unlock it and enter the west hall. Run past the rising zombie, and enter the second door you see (the other doors are inaccessible.) On the rack next to the entrance, you will find a plate. From where the plate is, push the table twice, then enter the crawlspace for some goodies. This will also confuse any zombies in this room, since they won't be able to find you. Exit the interrogation room, and turn right to find a painting where you can use your unicorn medal. Take any items you might deem useful, then return.

### Ben's plate: the secret file
Proceed to the reception desk, located behind the double doors in main hall 1F. Open the drawers for some goodies, and check the document on the sofa for a password. Now exit and go to the east offices. Input the password on the safe inside Marvin's office (the one with an isolated desk.) Take the secret file inside, and proceed to the holding cells in B1F. Here, Ben Bertolucci (the journalist at the end of the hallway) will give you a plate in exchange for the secret file.

Before putting the remaining plates, you might be interesting in some goodies. There are several areas with plenty of ammo, weapons and healing items.

## Other places of interest

The rooftop: this is easiest for player 1 to explore. You will find handgun bullets, and the occasional red herb.

The night duty room: Kevin can open a locker (the one closest to the corner) for some handgun or shotgun ammo, in addition to the Joker key.

The substation room: There is always a green herb, and sometimes also a red herb. Look inside the drawer for more ammo, or a survival knife.

The kennel: you can find plenty of ammo here, including some handgun (or handgun HP) clips. Be careful of the dogs.

The parking garage: Mark can push a police car close to the shutter for a wooden pole, and probably some ammo. If Mark is not on your team, two people are needed to push the car.

The east offices: Kevin can open his desk (second from the left, opposite the wall) for some recovery pills, and can also unlock Jean's desk (the one exactly opposite Kevin's) for more pills or ammo. Jean's desk password is always 0325.

1F east hall: Alyssa can unlock a cabinet for some handgun or shotgun ammo.

B1F east hall: David can open a box in front of the stairs for some ammo or a survival knife. There are also several herbs along the hallway, and the occasional clip/gas neutralizing canister.

The reception desk: Alyssa can unlock the drawer for ammo or a survival knife.

Main hall, 2F: herbs, gas neutralizing canisters, and handgun ammo can be found close to the double doors.

## Countdown to the siege

Now proceed to put the plates. After the cutscene ends, you have ~10 minutes to collect as much ammo, weapons and healing items as possible. You will certainly need them for the final part of this scenario. There are four main tasks in this part, though the first two are usually done together.

1. You must pick up the padlock key that spawned in the front entrance after the cutscene, then proceed to the roof to unlock a door with some goodies beneath, including four wooden planks. The planks can then be used in the front gate to delay the siege (maximum of three per gate.)
 
2. You must pick up the Film C, which spawns in the rooftop closest to the dead officer's body, then give it to Ben for a Magnum handgun.
    
3. You must open the shutter in the parking garage by operating the computer in the main hall.

4. You must enter the garage ramp, located beneath said shutter, to find some goodies and the film B. Give it to Ben for an SMG.

On Very Hard, it's impossible for one player to perform both 3 and 4, so you will need the help of a partner. Since 3 and 4 are pretty straightforward, I will give instructions for 1 and 2.

Pick up the padlock key, remembering to leave any item in its place. Proceed to the east offices, then open the door opposite the east hall. Pick up any goodies the dead officer left behind before you aggro the zombies, then proceed upstairs to the 2F east hall, picking up any herbs in the way. Now turn right to the end of the hallway; you can find a recovery pill close to the door. Enter the roof, and unlock the metal door with the padlock key. Pick up any goodies, and if you have inventory space, some wooden plates.

Now approach the dead officer and pick up the film C. Return inside, and go to the emergency stairwell. Go down, avoiding the crow and the zombies, and go to the police station's front entrance. If you have any wooden plates, use the planks in either the single or double metal doors. Also, make sure to pick up the film A, which spawned in this area. In any case, you might optionally want to revisit the kennel before the cells for an additional film, located in the farthest cell. Give the film C to Ben, and he will reward your efforts with a Magnum handgun, loaded with three shots. The other two films can be exchanged for recovery pills.

After you're ready, wait for the cutscene to kick in. You can also talk to Marvin to start the siege at any time, though this is not recommended in online play.

## The siege

The following part is hands down the hardest in the Outbreak series. After the cutscene, you and your allies will be surrounded by a zombie horde. As you kill them, more will spawn. You need a total of 50 kills on Very Hard online. Every ammo, weapon, or healing will make this part a little less harder. For instance, the shotgun will throw zombies away when used up close; the burst handgun will do wonders if Jim shoots it, due to increased critical hit rate. And most importantly, the handgun HP does the same damage, no matter the distance from the enemy. Potshotters should take full advantage of this.

Kevin and Alyssa should stay in the rear lines. Their potshots will save you tons of ammo. In addition, a magnum potshot will kill a zombie no matter what. Mark and Jim should stay in the front lines, using their melee weapons. The rest of the team can take any available weapon, and start attacking. Note that the capsule shooter one-hit-kills zombies when loaded with anti virus pills, though recovery pills are a better use of herbs for George.

Try to be together at all times. If you need any item, wait for the zombies to aggro on another ally, then quickly go pick up anything you need. If you ever run out of ammo, everyone can move to the area with the wooden crates, and start knifing away. This works best with David, but in a pinch, any character will do.

After 50 zombies die, the scenario ends.
