# Elimination 2

## Overview

Also known as *Poison Alley,* this challenge will keep you on your toes. Lots of powerful weaponry, including the coveted Grenade Launcher with fire rounds. Yes, fire rounds!

But there are also **tons** of enemies that are able to poison, and some others that can instakill. Bees, scissortails, bites and web spinners are around every corner.

There's a particularly nasty seed with *tons* of weaponry but extremely few healing items. There's also another seed which hides a very valuable secret outside the hospital...

As you can guess, Cindy is very useful with her herbs, as is George with his pills.
