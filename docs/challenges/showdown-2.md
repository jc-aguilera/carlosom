# Showdown 2

This challenge is *a lot* harder than Showdown 1. While there are more healing items, and roughly the same weapon availability, enemies are much more dangerous, with all but one having instakill attacks. Stage 3 is particularly difficult, which has *respawning* enemies!

## Stage 1: Oscar (Titan)

## Stage 2: Max (Stalker)

## Stage 3: Gigabite

## Stage 4: Tyrant-R

## Stage 5: Nyx
